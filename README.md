# New Relic Videojs Tracker Agent

The New Relic Videojs Tracker enhances your media applications by tracking video events, playback errors, and other activities, providing comprehensive insights into performance and user interactions.

- The Videojs tracker is available as a ready-to-use JavaScript snippet for easy copy-paste integration.
- New Relic Videojs tracker auto-detects events emitted by Videojs Player.
- Ensure that the **Browser agent** is successfully instrumented before deploying the media tracker.
- For questions and feedback on this package, please visit the [Explorer's Hub](https://discuss.newrelic.com), New Relic's community support forum.
- Looking to contribute to the Player Name agent code base? See [DEVELOPING.md](./DEVELOPING.md) for instructions on building and testing the browser agent library, and Contributors.

## Adding The Videojs Tracker To Your Project

To integrate New Relic Tracker Agent into your web application effectively, you'll need to instrument the Browser Agent code first and then add the player script. Below is a guide on how to do this within your HTML file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>New Relic Tracker Integration</title>
    <script src="path/to/browser-agent.js"></script>
    <!-- snippet code generated  -->
    <script src="path/to/videojs-tracker.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Your HTML content -->
  </body>
</html>
```

## Adding the agent package to your project

To make the tracker available to your application, install via [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-install) or [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/install/).

```shell
$ npm install @newrelic/video-videojs
```

```shell
$ yarn add @newrelic/video-videojs
```

## Instantiating the Videojs Tracker



```javascript

import VideojsTracker from "@newrelic/video-videojs"; 

// Add a VideojsTracker
player.version = videojs.VERSION
const tracker = new VideojsTracker(player);

//For setting custom attributes const tracker
const tracker = new VideojsjsTracker(player, {
  customData: {
    contentTitle: 'Override Existing Title',
    customPlayerName: 'myGreatPlayer',
    customPlayerVersion: '9.4.2',
  },
});

// For setting userId
tracker.setUserId('userId');

// For Sending custom Action with Attributes

const tracker = new nrvideo.VideojsTracker(player);

nrvideo.Core.addTracker(tracker);

tracker.sendCustom('CUSTOM_ACTION', 'state time', {
  test1: 'value1',
  test2: 'value2',
});
```

## Data Model

To understand which actions and attributes are captured and emitted by the Videojs Player under different event types, see [DataModel.md](./DATAMODEL.md).
